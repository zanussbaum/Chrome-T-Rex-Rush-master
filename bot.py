"""
This will be the created bot stub which our genetic program will 'design'
It has functions to respond to the on screen events
It will be constantly calling event functions based on screen (update every 0.1 sec??)
    --> Possible second variable parameter for mutation or crossover
Once a certain threshold is reached (differs from event to event), it will trigger its action
These functions are going to be our actual crossover as such hopefully maintaining good responses

TODO:
Write the stubs for every permutation of events and write the main runner
Parallelize runners
Seed original parameters
Generate Population
Write the genetic runner
